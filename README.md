Upon launching the `index.html` file, users are presented with a webpage featuring an interactive map of Calgary, enabling them to zoom in or out for enhanced geographical scrutiny. On this interface, they can utilize the date range picker tool embedded within the website to filter building permits issued within a precise timeframe. Upon selecting and submitting their desired time period via the search function, users will observe multiple markers pinpointing the corresponding building permits within that particular epoch in Calgary.

When the map is zoomed out to a certain level where marker proximity becomes visually dense, clusters of markers will automatically coalesce into bubbles, each annotated with the number of aggregated points for improved visual organization. Upon clicking such a cluster, it will disperse to reveal all the individual markers contained within. Subsequently, upon interacting with any given marker, detailed information pertaining to the associated building permit will be displayed.
